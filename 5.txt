The Gospel.
John 3 : 16 ; S. S. S. 221,
1 Come and listen while I tell you
What the Lord will do for you
If you bring your sins to Jesus,
You need only trust Him true;
His own precious blood will wash
you.
And your sins He will forgive;
He will send the Holy Spirit,
Always in your heart to live.

He died for you on Calvary;
The Father gave His only Son,
From sin to make you free.

2 He will give you life eternal
At the moment you believe.
When you trust in Christ the

Saviour,
You are born a child of God;
He will blot out all the story
Of your life so full of sin,
And the book of Life so wondrous
He will write your name within.

3 There will be great joy in Heaven
Unto God's beloved Son,
When from death to life He brings
you,
And another soul is won,
He will hold you fast for ever
With His own almighty hand,
And for you a heavenly mansion
He prepares in that bright land.

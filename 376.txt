HYMN 376
WITH MY SAVIOUR

1 With my Saviour ever near 
to guide me
I am safe, whatever may betide me
From the storm and tempest 
He will hide me
In the hallow of His hand

In the hallow, of His hand
In the hallow of His hand
I am safe whatever may betide me
In the hallow of His hand

2 In His arms of love 
He safely holds me
Words of peace His loving voice hath told me
I am safe, for God Himself will hold me
In the hallow of His hand

3 He will guide my soul, 
and leave me never
From His love no power on earth shall sever
And I know He keeps me now and ever
In the hallow of His hand

8 John 9 : 35-38, S, S. S. 493. 
1 My Saviour died upon the Cross, 
His blood ran down for me 
I can, I will, I do believe 
That Jesus died for me. 

I will believe, I do believe, 
That Jesus died for me;
That on the Cross He shed His Blood, 
From sin to set me free. 

2 A sinner far away  from God, 
Lord, now I come to Thee:
I can, I Will, I do believe 
That Jesus died for me.

3 My eyes were blind, my heart was 
dark 
Praise God, I now can see! 
I can, I will, I do believe 
That Jesus died for me. 

4 My heart is glad, my lips rejoice, 
My happy soul is free 
I can, I will, I do believe 
That Jesus died for me.

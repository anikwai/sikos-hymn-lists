HYMN 164
COME EVERYONE THAT IS THIRSTY

1 Come everyone that is thirsty in spirit
Come everyone that is weary and sad
Come to the Savior there’s 
fullness in Jesus 
All your hearts’ longing for;
Come and be glad

I will pour water on him that is thirsty
I will pour floods upon the dry ground
Open your hearts 
for the blessing I bring you
While you are seeking Me, I will be found

2 Child of the Father 
be filled with His Spirit
Only His fullness can meet all your need
He gives you power 
for life and for service
This is His promise so certain indeed

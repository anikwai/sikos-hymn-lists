6 Matt. 11 : 28; S. S. S. 837
If I come to Jesus, He will make
me glad;
He will make happy when my 
heart is sad.
If I come to lesus, happy I shall be;
He is gently calling everyone like me.

2 If I come to Jesus, He will savefrom sin,
Fil mewith His, wash and make me clean.

3 If I come to Jesus, He will hearmy prayer:
For He loves me dearly and sins did bear.

4 If I come to Jesus, He will take my hand:
He will kindly lead me to the
better land.

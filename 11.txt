11 1 John 4 : 19 ; S. S. S. 376.
1 Jesus was the first to love  us
Our dear Lord came from the sky,
Lived a life of shame andd sorrow,
Then a shameful  death did die.
We must all have died forever
Had not Jesus died instead
Now our sins may all be covered,
By the precious blood He shed.

2. 0h, how dearly He has loved us
Long before we loved at all
Now with us He standeth pleading,
And His loving voice doth call.
'Do you love Me? Do you love Me?"
Now I think I hear Him say
And He waiteth for the answer
Which my heart will give today.

3 Jesus, Lord ! I think I love Thee
But I want to love Thee more.
Now pray Thee, send Thy Spirit
In my heart Thy, love to pour.
"If ye love me, if ye love me"
Hark! again I hear Him say-
"Do the things you know will
please me
All My loving words obey. "

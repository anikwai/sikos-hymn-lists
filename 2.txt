2 Heb. 9 : 22 ; S. S. S. 874

1 What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
What can make me clean within?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

Oh, precious, precious bood,
From Jesus side it flowed!
What frees me from my load
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

2 What can cleanse my sinful heart?
Nothing bLit the blood of Jesus!
Blot out all the guilty past?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

3 What can save me from the pit?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
And for Heaven make me fit?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

4 What can bring me near to God?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
Keep me clean along life's road?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

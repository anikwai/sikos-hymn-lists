3 Jer 21:8, S. S. S. 472 
1 Behold, I set before you all 
Two roads-which will you choose? 
The way of life, the way of death? 
Choose life, and death refuse. 

I am the Way, the Tyuth, and the life 
No man cometh unto the Father 

but by Me. 

2 0ne is a broad and crooked road, 
The end of it is Hell ; 
This road men follow their own way, 
So people like it well 

3 Christ Jesus rnade another road 
To life and joy and day 
It is the straight and narrow road, 
Now hear the Saviour say 

4 "I am the Door-if any man 
Will enter in by me 
He shall be saved! I give him life, 
Life for eternity." 

5 Come, enter through the narrow 
gate 
We show to you the way;
My brothers, come before too late 
Take Jesus Christ today.

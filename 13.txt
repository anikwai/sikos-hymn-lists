The Gospel.
John 6 : 37 ; S. S S. 467

1 I come to Thee,
my Saviour dear,
I come today;
I bring Thee all my many sins
To wash away.

2
I come to Thee to save me from
My load of sin;
I come to Thee to make me free

And clean within.

3 I bring Thee all the sinful things

That I have done;
Forgive me, Father, through the name
Of Thy dear Son.

4 Thy loving voice says unto me,
"Give Me thy heart, "
Lord here it is, come in to stay,

Do not depart.

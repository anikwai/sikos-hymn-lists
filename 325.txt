HYMN 325
MUST I GO

1 Must I go, and empty-handed
Thus my dear Redeemer meet
Not one day of service give Him
Lay no present at His feet

Must I go, and empty-handed
Must I meet my Saviour so
Not one soul with which to greet Him
Must I empty-handed go

2 Oh, the years of sinning wasted
Could I but recall them now
I would give them to my Saviour
To His will I gladly bow

3 Oh, my brothers, wake be earnest
Up and work while it is day
Soon the night will overtake you
Seek for souls while still you may

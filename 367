HYMN 367
ANYWHERE WITH JESUS

1 Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go
Anywhere He leads me 
in this world below
Anywhere without Him 
dearest joy would fade
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid

Anywhere, anywhere
Fear I cannot know
Anywhere with Jesus 
I can safely go

2 Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone
Other friends may fail me
He is still my own

3 Though His hands may lead me 
Over dreary ways
Anywhere with Jesus 
is a house of praise

4 Anywhere with Jesus 
over land and sea
Telling souls in darkness 
of salvation free

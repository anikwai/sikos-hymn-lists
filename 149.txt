Hymn 149
JESUS KEEP ME NEAR THE CROSS

1 Jesus keep me near the cross
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream
Flows from Calvary’s mountain

In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river

2 Near the Cross, a trembling soul
Love and mercy found me
There the Bright and Morning Star
Shed its beams around me

3 Near the Cross O Lamb of God
Bring its scenes before me
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadow oe’r me

4 Near the Cross I’ll watch and wait
Hoping trusting ever
Till I reach the golden strand
Just beyond the river

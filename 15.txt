Joshua 24 : 15 ;  S.S.S
15 P6 The Gospel 

1 While Jesus whispers to you,
come, sinner come!
While we are praying for you,
Come, sinner come!
Now is the time to choose Him
Come, sinner Come!
Now is the time! Believe Him!
Come, sinner Come!

2 All who are heavy laden,
Jesus will take your burden,
Jesus will not deceive you,
Jesus will receive you.

3 He will forgive you freely,
Because He loves you dearly.
Come all your sins confessing. 
Come and receive His blessing.

4 Rise now and come to Jesus 
Christ Jesus died to save us 
Take him to be your saviour 
He will forsake you never.

4 1 John 4 : 19 ; S. S. S. 1155
Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak, but He is strong.

Yes, lesus loves me
The Bible tells me so.

2 Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin-
Let His little child come in.

3 Jesus loves me! He will stay
Close beside me all the way
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high.

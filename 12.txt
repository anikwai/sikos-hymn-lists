1 Tim. 1 : 15 ; S, S S367121 Listen to the Gospel storyJesus died for sinful men;We have told the story often,We must tell it out again.Oh, glad and glorious Gospel!With joy we make it plain:A full and free salvationThroughfaith in Jesus name.2 Still upon His hands the nailmarksAnd the marks upon His brow,Our Redeemer, Lord and Saviour,In the glory sitting now.3 But remember this same Jesus,In the clouds will come again,He will call His blood-bought peopleWith Himself to live and reign.

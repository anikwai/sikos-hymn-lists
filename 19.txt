19 Hebrew. 7:25; S. s.s. 350
1 I have a Saviour, now praying in glory,

A dear loving Saviour who once died for you,

And now He has sent us to tell you the story,

That hearing of His love,  you may trust Him too.

For you He is praying,
For you He is praying,
The Saviour  is prayjng,
Is praying for you.

2 I have a Saviour, for you He is
praying,
That you may be willingto let Him
Come ln
He laid down His life toredeem
you from sinning,
To wash you, that you anew life
may begin.

3 I have a Saviour, Who never forsakes
us,

I want you to take Him as your
saviour too;
Come now and believe Him, receive
the Lord Jesus,
Your saviour, your Master, to make
you all new.

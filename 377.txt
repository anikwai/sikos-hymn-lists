HYMN 377
I WOULD ALWAYS WALK WITH JESUS

I would always walk with Jesus
In His fellowship divine
Oh, the joy of sweet communion
I am His, and He is mine

Close to Thee, close to Thee
Close to Thee, close to Thee
In communion sweet with Jesus
May I always walk with Thee

In my quite time I find Him
As my Comforter and Friend
May His glory and His beauty
Be with me until the end

When I failed, and when I wandered
Broken-hearted, sad and sore
He has lifted, and forgiven
Brought me near to 
Him once more

In dark nights of pain and sorrow
With my Saviour I have trod
Sweetest lessons He has taught me
When I walked alone with God

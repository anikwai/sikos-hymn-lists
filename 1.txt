Acts 16:31; S.S.S.49.
1 Who from Heaven came to earth?
Jesus Chris my Saviour
Came a little child of earth?
Jesus Christ my Saviour!

Christ Jesus left the sky,
Christ lesus came to die,
He will hear the sinner's cry,
He came to be my Saviour,

2 Who was crucified for me?
Jesus Christ my Saviour!
On the Cross of Calvary?
Jesus Christ my Saviour!

3 Who has promised to forgive?
Jesus Christ my Saviour!
Who hath said : Believe and live?
Jesus Christ my Saviour!

4 Who from Heaven soon shall come?
Jesus Christ my Saviour!
Take to glory all His own?
Jesus Christ my Saviour!

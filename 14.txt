Rom. 6 : 23 ; S. S. S. 430

1 Where will you spend Eternity-
This question  comes to yo u and me!
Tell me, what will your answer be
-
Where will you spend Eternity?

Eternity! Eternity!
Where will you spend Eternity
2 many are choosing Christ today,
Turning from all their sins away. 
Heaven their blessed home shall be:
Where will you spend Eternity?

3 leaving the straight and narrow way,
Going the downward road today,
What shall the end of your life be
Where will you spend Eternity?

4 Turn, and believe this very hour,
Trust in the Saviour's grace and
power:

Then shall your happy answer be,
Saved for along Eternityl

Eternity! Eternity!
Saved for a long Eternity!

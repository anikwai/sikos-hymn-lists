Hymn 47
TO GOD BE THE GLORY

1 To God be the glory, 
Great things He hath done
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin
And opened the Life-gate 
That all may go in

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
All the earth hear His voice
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Let the people rejoice
Oh come to the Father, through Jesus the Son
And give Him the glory 
Great things He hath done

2 Oh perfect redemption, 
the purchase of blood
To every believer the promise of God
The vilest offender who truly believes
That moment from Jesus a pardon received

3 Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the son
But purer, and higher and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see

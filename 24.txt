HYMN 24
OH PRECIOUS WORDS THAT JESUS SAID

1 Oh precious words that Jesus said
The soul that comes to Me
I will in no wise cast him out
Whatever he may be

Whoever he may be
Whoever he may be
I will in no wise cast him out
Whoever he may be

2 Oh precious words that Jesus said
Behold I am the Door
And all that enter in by Me
Have life for evermore

Whoever he may be
Whoever he may be
I will in no wise cast him out
Whoever he may be

3 Oh precious words that Jesus said
Come weary souls opprest
And take My yoke and learn of Me
And I will give you rest

Whoever he may be
Whoever he may be
I will in no wise cast him out
Whoever he may be

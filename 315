HYMN 315
THERE IS NO LOVE

1 There is no love like the love of Jesus
Never to change at all
Till in His beautiful mansions above
Jesus gathers us all


Jesusâ€™ love, changeless love
Boundless and full and free
Oh, turn to His love weary, 
wandering soul
Jesus seeketh for thee

2 There is no heart like the heart of Jesus
Full of a tender love
No sorrow or trouble our hearts can know
But He feels it above

3 Oh, let us hear that sweet voice of Jesus
Calling us to His side
Safely we rest on His loving breast
Like a small trusting child

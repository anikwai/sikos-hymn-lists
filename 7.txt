Luke 19 : 10 ; S. S, S, 669
1 God so loved the world of sinners
That He gave His Son-
Sent His only Son to
save us 
Seek us every one.
jesus came to seek and save us-
call us every one.
On the Cross He died for sinners
God's beloved Son.

2 All was done, yes! all was finished,
All our debt was paid
On the Lamb of God so holy
All our sin was laid

3 God the Father called Him Jesus,
Saviour from all sin
Punishment for us He suffered,

Lifefor us to win.

Hymn 142
THERE WAS ONE

1 There was One who was willing 
to die in my stead
That a soul so unworthy might live
And the road to the cross 
He was willing to tread
All the sins of my life to forgive

They are nailed to the cross
They are nailed to the cross
Oh how much He was willing to bear
With what suffering and loss
Jesus went to the cross
And He carried my sins with Him there

2 He is tender and loving and patient with me
While He cleanses my heart of its dross
But thereâ€™s no condemnation
I know I am free
For my sins are all nailed to the cross

3 I will cling to my Savior and never depart
I will joyfully journey each day
With a song on my lips 
And a song in my heart
That my sins have been taken away
